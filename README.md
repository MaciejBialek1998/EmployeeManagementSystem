# EmployeeManagementSystem
Employee management system application developed by Maciej Białek

To demonstrate my existing skills and continue learning about Java and its related frameworks I 
have built an employee management application. This includes:

• Different types of users (Admins and employees)

• Admin users can create, edit and delete employees

• Employee profiles that contain relevant information for each employee

• A task management feature which allows tasks to be assigned to employees

• Employees can login, view their personal details, view and complete task that are 
assigned to tchem

• The application was written in program Intelij with the backend in Java and the frontend 
in HTML and CSS

• The database was written in MySQL using MySQL Workbench

• To build the application I used tools and frameworks such as Maven, Spring framework, 
Spring boot, Hibernate, Spring data JPA, Thymeleaf, Spring security and MySQL

To run application Java 17 is required.
Project is still under development.
